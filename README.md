# EEE3088F_Micromouse_Project_Group-68

---

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Micromouse project, developed for the University of Cape Town.

## Overview

The Micromouse is a small autonomous robot designed to navigate a maze. This project aims to develop a maze-solving algorithm and implement it on the Micromouse robot.

## Features

- Autonomous maze-solving algorithm
- IR sensors for wall detection
- STM32 microcontroller for control
- PCB design for sensor subsystem
- Integration with motor control, sensor subsystem, and power subsystem

## Getting Started

To get started with the Micromouse project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary software and tools (STM32CubeIDE, KiCad).
3. Compile and upload the code to your Micromouse robot.
4. Test the robot in a maze environment.

## Code Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the Micromouse project.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation for the project.
- `hardware/`: Contains PCB design files and schematics.
- `tests/`: Contains test code for the Micromouse.

## Dependencies

- KiCad: For your PCB design, you likely used KiCad, an open-source software for designing electronic schematics and PCBs.
- STM32CubeIDE: This is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for STM32 microcontrollers, which you mentioned using in your project.

## Power Subsystem

The power subsystem for the Micromouse project includes a LiPo battery (1S1P) for powering the robot. The power subsystem is responsible for providing stable power to all components of the Micromouse.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Create a new Pull Request.
